# RefreshMetadata_NFT_collection
This script automates the process of refreshing metadata for a collection of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) hosted on the Polygon (Matic) network. It can efficiently update NFT metadata, whether stored on IPFS or hosted on regular URLs. Ideal for NFT creators and collectors looking to maintain accurate and up-to-date metadata for their tokens.


How It Works:

Install Dependencies: Begin by installing the necessary Node.js packages. Open your terminal and navigate to the script's directory, then run the following command to install the required packages:

shell
Copy code
npm install
This command installs the essential libraries, including ethers, axios, and progress-string, which are used to interact with the Polygon network, fetch metadata, and display progress.

Run the Script: After installing the dependencies, execute the script using Node.js:

shell
Copy code
node refreshMetadata.js
Automatic Metadata Refresh: The script utilizes the Polygon (Matic) RPC URL to interact with the blockchain and fetch the token URIs for a given NFT collection.

URI Analysis: It then checks each token's URI to determine whether it points to IPFS or a regular URL.

Thirdweb Integration: If the URI is an IPFS link, it uses Thirdweb's storage service to access the metadata, ensuring proper authentication using the provided secret key and client ID.

Direct URL Fetch: If the URI is a regular URL, it directly fetches the metadata.

Progress Tracking: The script provides real-time progress updates, allowing users to monitor the refresh process as it proceeds through the collection.

Key Features:

Automatic Metadata Refresh: The script automates the process of refreshing metadata for a large collection of NFTs, eliminating the need for manual updates on platforms like OpenSea.

Thirdweb Integration: It leverages Thirdweb's storage service to securely access metadata stored on IPFS, ensuring that the script works seamlessly with NFT collections created on the Thirdweb platform.

Who Should Use This Script:

NFT Creators: If you've created an NFT collection, this script can help ensure that your metadata remains accurate and accessible to collectors.
